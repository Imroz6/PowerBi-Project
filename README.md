# PowerBi-Project
A project on India's Last Minute App
In this project, I developed comprehensive visuals analyzing Blinkit's grocery sales and services, focusing on key metrics such as sales performance, service efficiency, and customer behavior. The project was built using Power BI, with an aim to provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making. The dashboard presents clear, interactive visualizations to aid in understanding sales trends, operational bottlenecks, and areas for service improvement.
